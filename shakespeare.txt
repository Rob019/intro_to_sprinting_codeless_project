To be or not to be, that is the question!
Whether 'tis nobler for the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
or to take arms against a sea of troubles
and, by opposing, end them.

To die, to sleep. And with a sleep of death
to say that we end the thousand natural pains
the flesh is hire to. Oh, 'tis a consummation
devoutly to be wished.

To die, to sleep. To sleep.. perchance to dream. Ahy, there is the rub!
